**[Emilio Mayorga](https://github.com/emiliom/)** will follow up on his [March meeting](https://cugos.org/meetings/2025-03-19/) presentation to drill into the use of the Python [HoloViz stack](https://holoviz.org) to create online dashboards (including [this one](https://squid-test1.azurewebsites.net)) for multi-faceted exploration of data from autonomous, depth-profiling platforms in the ocean. The [Argo program](https://argo.ucsd.edu) is the best example of this data type.



If there's time, [Emilio Mayorga](https://github.com/emiliom/) will briefly describe the use of the Python [HoloViz stack](https://holoviz.org) to create custom online dashboards that allow multi-faceted exploration of data from autonomous, depth-profiling platforms in the ocean (the [Argo program](https://argo.ucsd.edu) is the best example of these data). I could turn this into a more extended dive (pun intended) into the innards of the HoloViz packages for this type of data, at the *next* CUGOS meeting.
